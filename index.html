      // Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable declarations (using var)
      // and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope by the JavaScript
      //  engine during the compilation phase, before the code is actually executed.
      //   This means that even if a variable is declared at the bottom of a function, it can be accessed
      //   from the top of that function.
      num = 10;
    //   num = 10 //We can do this
      console.log(window.num);
    //   without below line it steel work above line but initializing is mandatory.
      var num;

      // However, let and const are not hoisted in the same way. When you declare a variable using
      // let or const, it is not initialized to undefined until its declaration is evaluated during runtime.
      // This means that if you try to access a let or const variable before it has been declared, you will
      //  get a ReferenceError.

      // num1=30;
      // console.log(num1); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'num1' before initialization
      // let num1;//declaration not get evaluated

      // num2=30;
      // console.log(num2); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
      // const num2;

      // Block Scope

          let x = 2; // new variable x is created within this block
          console.log(x); // output: 2
        }
        console.log(x); // output: 1
